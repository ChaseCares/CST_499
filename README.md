# Senior Capstone: Campus Network Architecture

## Problem Statement

A new local community college has asked for assistance building their network and creating the web interface. The team must build the school network structure and configure all devices for all buildings so each device can communicate locally and on the internet. The website will need to be user-friendly and functional for all new students and faculty members. The cost for this project will be discussed with the team and the school dean before, during, and after the projectâ€™s completion.
